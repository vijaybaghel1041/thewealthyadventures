    <h1>The Coffee Table Invest</h1>
    <p>It all started over a cup of chai on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
    <p>Arjun, Meera, and Vikram had been friends since college—bound not just by memories, but by a common worry in their late 20s: <strong>"Are we saving enough?"</strong> “Are we investing right?” “Where does our money even go every month?”</p>
    <p>One day, instead of gossiping about office life or Netflix shows, they decided to do something radical. They opened a spreadsheet. Together.</p>
    <p>They called it <strong>The Coffee Table Portfolio</strong>.</p>
    <p>Each of them contributed ₹2,000 per month—less than a night out. They met every month at a coffee shop, reviewed stocks, SIPs, mutual funds, and brainstormed startups they admired. Over time, they learned about compounding, took small risks, lost a bit, gained more—and grew smarter with every decision.</p>
    <p>Five years later, the Coffee Table Portfolio had grown into a solid investment fund. But more importantly, it had grown their confidence. They now had shared assets, a startup idea in motion, and something no bank could offer: <strong>a tribe of trust</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      “You don’t need to be rich to invest. You just need the right friends.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>What started as friendship turned into <strong>financial freedom</strong>—powered not by apps, but by accountability and curiosity.</p>
