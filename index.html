    <h1>My Investing Journey</h1>
    <p>I’m Jagruti Goswami, and my journey with investing started long before I even knew what investing was.</p>
    <p>As a kid, I’d watch my dad come home from work, switch on CNBC, and ask me to keep an eye on the prices of silver, gold, and copper. I didn’t really know why. I thought it was just a habit. What I didn’t realize was that he had been investing since the 1990s — and trying, in his own way, to introduce me to the world of money.</p>
    <p>But I told myself I was "bad at maths", so this world couldn’t possibly be for me. I never tried to learn.</p>
    <p>Things changed in college. I met two friends who were actively investing — and suddenly, investing didn’t feel so foreign. On my 18th birthday, my dad gifted me something that changed my life: an Upstox account and a few shares. That was the beginning.</p>
    <p>I started learning, exploring, making mistakes, and growing. But I also noticed something important — very few people around me, in college or corporate life, had even a basic understanding of finance or money management.</p>
    <blockquote>
      “If so many of us are in the dark, someone needs to turn the lights on.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>That’s why I created <strong>WealthyAdventures</strong> — not just for women, not just for finance experts — but for anyone who ever thought they weren’t “meant” for this world. Because you don’t need to be rich or perfect at numbers to take control of your finances. You just need a place to start.</p>
